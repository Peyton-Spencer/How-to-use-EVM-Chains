# How to use EVM Blockchains
So you have a Metamask Wallet setup, but trying out the chains is clunky!

## Adding a chain to your wallet
This site connects to your Metamask, and has hotlinks that add an "EVM network" to your wallet.
[Chainlist](https://chainlist.org)

## Searching onchain
Block explorers such as Etherscan are the Googles of the blockchain.
Each chain has its own explorer; etherscan, polygonscan, arbiscan to name a few.

## Debugging
- If you do not see your Network in Metamask, use chainlist.org
  1. Connect your Wallet to Chainlist
  2. Search for the name of your network
  3. Press the Add Network button
  4. Accept in your Wallet
- If you cannot see a token balance in your Wallet, you want to import the token!
  1. You will need the Contract Address of the token, for your Wallet to recognize the token
  2. Search on the chain's Block Explorer for the name of your token
  3. Tap on the token page and copy the Contract Address
  4. Paste the contract address into Metamask's "import token" page
